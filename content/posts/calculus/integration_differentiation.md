Back in high school, I remember being introduced to the key concepts in calculus. First, the  <strong>derivative</strong> was presented as the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a given point. Then the  <strong>integral</strong> was defined as the area under the curve. And finally the leap of faith: both operations were inverses of each other. 

I remember being confused about this statement we were asked to blindly accept. And college did not help much in that regard. We were given a bunch of rules to compute derivatives and integrals, but the connection between them was never made clear. And that is precisely what we are going to do in this post. We will start by revisiting the definitions of the <strong>derivative</strong> and the <strong>integral</strong>, and then we will try to gain some geometric intuition about why they reverse each other.

All the <strong>code</strong> used to generate the animations in this article is available at the following public repository:

# 1. Derivative: The slope of the tangent line

The <strong>derivative</strong> $f'(x_0)$ of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x_0$ was introduced to us as the slope of the tangent line to a curve at $x_0$. In order to estimate it, we would take two points on the curve, $x_0$ and $x_0 + \Delta x$, and calculate the slope of the secant line between them:

$$
\begin{equation}
s(x)\approx \frac{f(x_0 + \Delta x) - f(x_0)}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}
$$

As the distance between the points decreases, our approximation of the slope of the tangent line would improve. And in the limit, as $\Delta x$ approaches zero, we would obtain the exact slope $s(x)$ of the tangent line at the point $x_0$. This is the definition of the derivative:

$$
\begin{equation}
s(x) = f'(x) = \frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}
$$

The following animation illustrates how the derivative is built geometrically as the slope of the secant line between two points on the curve.

# 2. Integral: The area under the curve

Then things got a bit more complicated when we were introduced to the <strong>integral</strong>. The integral of a function $f(x)$ over an interval $[a, b]$ was defined as the area under the curve $A$. In order to estimate it, one would divide the interval into $n$ subintervals of equal width $\Delta x$, where n is given by:

$$
\begin{equation}
n = \frac{b - a}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}
$$

Then we would sum the areas of the rectangles formed by the function values at the left endpoint of each subinterval. This is known as the <strong>left Riemann sum</strong>:

$$
\begin{equation}
A \approx \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(a + i\cdot \Delta x) \cdot \Delta x
\end{equation}
$$

As the width of the subintervals decreases, the approximation of the area under the curve would improve. And in the limit, as $\Delta x$ approaches zero, we would obtain the exact area $A(x)$ under the curve. This is the definition of the integral:

$$
\begin{equation}
A(x) = \int_{a}^{x} f(t) \cdot dt = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(a + i\cdot \Delta x) \cdot \Delta x
\end{equation}
$$

The following animation illustrates how the integral is built geometrically as the area under the curve.

# 3. Differentiating the area under the curve

And here is where magic happened! In order to show us how to compute the <strong>derivative</strong> of a function, the teacher started by applying the definition in Eq.(2) for a set of simple functions, such as polynomials. Then we were given a set of rules to compute the derivative of more complex functions.

Nonetheless, for computing the <strong>integral</strong>, we were simply told that it was the inverse operation of the derivative. So if we wanted to compute the integral of a function, we should find a function whose derivative is the one we are interested in. And that was it!

I remember wondering: <strong>how come the area under the curve is the inverse operation of the slope of the tangent line?</strong> It was not intuitive to me at all!"

Luckily, it turns out that there is a very simple geometric explanation for this. In order to understand it, we will resort to the geometric approximation of the derivative and the integral as defined them in the previous sections.
 * The <strong>derivative</strong> is approximated by the slope of the secant line between two points on the curve.
 * The <strong>integral</strong> is approximated by partitioning the interval into subintervals and summing the areas of the rectangles formed by the function values at the left endpoint of each subinterval.

So say we want to differentiate the function that corresponds to the area under the curve $A(x)$ in the interval $[a, x]$. According to Eq.(1), its derivative $A'(x)$ would be approximated by:

$$
\begin{equation}
A'(x) \approx \frac{A(x + \Delta x) - A(x)}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}
$$

We can expand the numerator using Eq.(4):

$$
\begin{equation}
A'(x) \approx \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(a + i\cdot \Delta x) \cdot \Delta x - \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(a + i\cdot \Delta x) \cdot \Delta x}{\Delta x}
\end{equation}
$$

And as we observe, all the terms in the sum cancel out except for the last one:

$$
\begin{equation}
A'(x) \approx f(a + n\cdot \Delta x) = f(x)
\end{equation}
$$

So the derivative of the area under the curve $A(x)$ is the function $f(x)$ itself! This is illustrated in the following animation:

The only remaining rectangle (<span style="color:#800080;">purple</span>) has width $\Delta x$ and height $f(x)$</figcaption>
